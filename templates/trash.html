        <p>Our historic building was not originally designed to handle residential trash. 
          Since at times the trash must be thrown in outside dumpsters, use sturdy bugs that are tied securely (plastic) or 
          stapled /taped (paper) closed. Please flatten cardboard boxes. Large item dump fee. $20 per item for large items, paid to Manager in advance. 
          Penalty for non-payment $100. Large items include mattresses, refrigerators, sofas, tables, water heaters, and similar bulky items that do not fit in the trash cart.
          <b>D</b> button in the freight elevator is the location of our trash/recycling area. 
          Trash bins use to be located on each floor in the freight corridor but due to smells and the addition of the 
          recycling program they've been moved.</p>
        <p>The trash containers in the luandry rooms are for laundry trash only; do not put household trash in th laundry room trash.</p>
